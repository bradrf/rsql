* Support separation of semicolon content from registered sql.

* Fix multiline dump to be columnar sensitive (i.e. all but the first
  line will need a prefix of previous column length whitespace.

* Add query to each new database seen to gather all table names and
  add them to the tab-complete list by tracking the table names in a
  database table hash.

* Add option to allow registration to include an automatic displayer.

* Add ability to save passwords in local OS password storage.

* Add ability to highlight lines (e.g. to indicate warning lines about
  some data like LastHeartbeatTime not recent).

* Add ability to allow for multi-line entry of data (e.g. to start a
  command with period and then have a multiline ruby script pasted
  in).

* Add way to prevent this and just allow the raw string to be printed:
  elsif HEX_RANGE.include?(field.type) && val =~ /[^[:print:]\s]/
      val = @@eval_context.to_hexstr(val)
  end
