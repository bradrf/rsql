* Support separation of semicolon content from registered sql.

* Fix multiline dump to be columnar sensitive (i.e. all but the first
  line will need a prefix of previous column length whitespace.

* Add query to each new database seen to gather all table names and
  add them to the tab-complete list by tracking the table names in a
  database table hash.

* Add option to allow registration to include an automatic displayer.

* Add ability to save passwords in local OS password storage.
