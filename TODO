* Support separation of semicolon content from registered sql.

* Fix multiline dump to be columnar sensitive (i.e. all but the first
  line will need a prefix of previous column length whitespace.

* Add option to allow registration to include an automatic displayer.

* Add ability to save passwords in local OS password storage.

* Add ability to highlight lines (e.g. to indicate warning lines about
  some data like LastHeartbeatTime not recent).

* Add way to prevent this and just allow the raw string to be printed:
  elsif HEX_RANGE.include?(field.type) && val =~ /[^[:print:]\s]/
      val = @@eval_context.to_hexstr(val)
  end

* Fix overlap of functionality between getting input in rsql and
  parsing input in commands.rb (e.g. they both duplicate the concepts
  of looking for exit/quit as well as what the end character(s) should
  be)

* Wrap calling of mysql query in a thread to make it interruptable
  (might need to re-establish a connection if it's stopped but
  expected a reply...look at the source).

* Consider using mysql's ping to determine if we need to reconnect.

* Move last_command logic into mysql_results and remember last five
  (or so).
