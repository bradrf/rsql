* Support separation of semicolon content from registered sql.

* Fix multiline dump to be columnar sensitive (i.e. all but the first
  line will need a prefix of previous column length whitespace.

* Add option to allow registration to include an automatic displayer.

* Add ability to save passwords in local OS password storage.

* Add ability to highlight lines (e.g. to indicate warning lines about
  some data like LastHeartbeatTime not recent).

* Add way to prevent this and just allow the raw string to be printed:
  elsif HEX_RANGE.include?(field.type) && val =~ /[^[:print:]\s]/
      val = @@eval_context.to_hexstr(val)
  end

* Move the more common helpers into the eval_context.
